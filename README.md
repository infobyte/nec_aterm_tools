# nec_aterm_tools
This repo contains two tools developed to gain shell on NEC Aterm routers:

1. `nec-aterm-firmware-config-extractor`: extracts the `HW_RANDOM_KEY` from a firmware image. This key is needed to gereate a valid passord for logging in.
2. `rakuraku-nec-shell`: extracts the `HW_RANDOM_KEY` from a QR code and generates a valid passowrd for logging in.
